<div align="center">A full-stack website, where users can see their car's emissions. <a href="http://fuelefficient.info">View the project!</a></div>  
<br/>

## Background
FuelEfficient allows users to understand their vehicle's emissions through a simple car selector tool.

The tool allows users to input the year, make, model, and variation of any vehicle and then displays personalized feedback. An example is shown below (this was run on a 2005 Suzuki Grand Vitara Automatic 4-spd):

## Data Sources
FuelEfficient sources vehicle data from the EPA's <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml">Fuel Economy Dataset</a>. Each row in the dataset contains the year/make/model/variation/mpg of the car alongside other extraneous information. For calculations in each distance card (100mi/10,000mi/150,000mi) the factors below are used:

- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are calculated by multiplying the MPG by <i>19.64</i> (lbs of CO<sub>2</sub> per gallon of gas) - <a href="https://www.patagoniaalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/How-much-carbon-dioxide-%20is-produced-by-burning-gasoline-and-diesel-fuel-FAQ-U.S.-Energy-Information-Administration-EIA.pdf">Source</a>
- The average household produces <i>7.5 tons</i> of CO<sub>2</sub> a year - <a href="https://www.ccfpd.org/Portals/0/Assets/PDF/Facts_Chart.pdf">Source</a>. This equates to <i>1,250lbs</i> per month
- An airliner releases <i>53lbs</i> of CO<sub>2</sub>  per mile - <a href="https://blueskymodel.org/air-mile">Source</a>. Since San Diego and Phoenix are <i>298.67mi</i> apart, this means that a flight between SD and PHX releases about <i>15,829.51lbs</i> of CO<sub>2</sub> - <a href="https://www.distance.to/Phoenix/San-Diego">Source</a>
- A tree absorbs approximately <i>1 ton</i> of CO<sub>2</sub> by the time it reaches 40 years old. This is equivalent to <i>2000lbs</i> of CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed per 40 year old tree - <a href="https://www.co2meter.com/blogs/news/could-global-co2-levels-be-reduced-by-planting-trees">Source</a>

## How It Works
FuelEfficient is built on a MySQL, Express, React, and NodeJS stack. A Python script is used to populate and update the DB using the EPA Fuel Economy Dataset.
### DB
The DB Updater Python script (found in `./DB Updater`) takes the following steps to populate the MySQL database with vehicles from the Fuel Economy dataset:
1. hi
2. hi
downloads and reads the Fuel Economy Dataset without writing it to disk. It then reads the downloaded `vehicles.csv` file using Pandas, and limits the dataset's scope to just the year/make/model/variation/fuelType/mpg of each car. 
### Backend
| Route | Params | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | -- | -- |
| `/api/v1.0/years` | none | `GET` | Retrieve all unique car years in the DB |
| `/api/v1.0/makes` | year | `GET` | Retrieve all possible makes for a given year |
| `/api/v1.0/models` | year, make | `GET` | Retrieve all models for a given year and make |
| `/api/v1.0/model-variations` | year, make, model | `GET` | Retrieve all model variations for a given year/make/model |
| `/api/v1.0/fuel-data` | year, make, model, variation | `GET` | Retrieve the MPG and mile calculations *(100mi/10,000mi/150,00mi data used in data cards on the frontend)* for a given year/make/model/variation |
### Frontend
Test

## Deployment
```
CREATE TABLE `vehicles` (
  `year` int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `make` varchar(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `model` varchar(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `variation` varchar(40) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `mpg` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `identifier` varchar(150) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  PRIMARY KEY (`identifier`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```
