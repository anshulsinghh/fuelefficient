# <div align="center">ðŸŒ¿ FuelEfficient</div>
<div align="center">A full-stack website, where users can see their car's emissions. <a href="http://fuelefficient.info">View the project!</a></div>  
<br/>

## What Is It?
FuelEfficient allows users to understand their vehicle's emissions through a simply car selector tool.

The tool allows users to input the year, make, model, and variation of any vehicle and then displays a personalized feedback. An example is shown below (this was run on a 2005 Suzuki Grand Vitara Automatic 4-spd):

</p>


FuelEfficient sources vehicle MPG data from the EPA's <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml">Fuel Economy Dataset</a>. Each row in the dataset contains the year/make/model/variation of the car, as well as the car's MPG. This data is parsed and used by FuelEfficient 
## How It Works
FuelEfficient is built on a MySQL, Express, React, and NodeJS stack.

## Deployment
```
CREATE TABLE `vehicles` (
  `year` int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `make` varchar(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `model` varchar(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `variation` varchar(40) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `mpg` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `identifier` varchar(150) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  PRIMARY KEY (`identifier`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```
